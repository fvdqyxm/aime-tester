I made this project in middle school.
While competing for math competitions, I found that searching up the answer would make me learn less than getting my answer verified, so I build a script that uses Beautiful Soup to web scrape
the Art of Problem Solving website to get the answers for each exam. Then, I created c++ code to parse and verify my answers.

I eventually expanded this project to the Harvard-Mit Mathematics Competition(HMMT).
